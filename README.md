### 🧠 About Me

I’m a developer who builds systems — not just code.  
In just over a year, I’ve worked across multiple domains including:

- 🧠 AI Integration: Dynamic prompting, face recognition (ArcFace + ONNX), speech-to-text, diarization
- ⚙️ Backend/API Dev: Laravel, FastAPI, Flask
- 🔁 Background Task: RabbitMQ, Redis, custom decorators
- 🕵️ Automation: Web scraping, LinkedIn profile crawler
- 🐳 DevOps: Docker, multi-service orchestration, CI/CD workflows
- 🧩 Prompt-to-SQL: Natural language queries converted into dynamic SQL
- 🧠 Content Recommendation (prototype): Semantic-based post suggestions

Many of the systems I’ve built are internal or under NDA — but here’s a general idea of the kind of work I do.

### 📦 Work Philosophy

> "If it's repetitive, I automate it.  
> If it's messy, I refactor it.  
> If it's internal, I secure it.  
> If it's painful, I document it."

I love building systems that actually work in production, scale well, and make my team faster.
